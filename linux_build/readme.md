How to build the programs
-------------------------

After installing sdsl-lite found on the parent directory of this file,
change the **SDSL_BASE_DIR** variable to point to the directory of the sdsl-lite
libraries.

Typing make on each of the subdirectories should build the programs.

On my machine I see some warning messages, which do not affect the correctness
of the executables.
