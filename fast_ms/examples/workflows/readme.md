# Workflow example
This example shows how to build and query a set
of matching statistic (MS) files. The MS files are generated
by comparing each query file to the index file.


To run the example make sure you have installed the library
as described
[in the guide](https://github.com/odenas/indexed_ms#installing-and-testing).
Then, simply type `snakemake -j2`.
