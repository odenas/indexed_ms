name: "Multilpe query MS computation"
description: Build the MS for all sequences in a query fasta file. Consider two fasta
    files, ``targets.fa`` and ``queries.fa``, each having one or more sequences. This workflow
    computes the matching statistics for all query sequences in ``queries.fa``
    against all target sequences in ``targets.fa``.
