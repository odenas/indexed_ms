This folder contains datasets and scripts to generate them.

`generate_input.py` generates both inputs of the same type, whether
`generate_input2.py` (is more recent) has some more flexibility.

Folders ending in `2` use the latter. 

The `testing` folder has datasets to test code. Some of the datasets
there are manually generated.
